<!--KLARO (cookies policy) To make sure that no third-party scripts are loaded without consent,
  you need to modify your HTML code a tiny bit: For inline scripts,
   replace the value of the type attribute with text/plain
    (this keeps the browser from executing the script) 
    and add a data attribute with the original type, e.g.
     data-type="application/javascript". Also add a data-name 
     attribute that matches the name of the given app in your config, e.g. data-name="googleAnalytics".

For external script do the same, but in addition 
rename the src attribute to data-src (this ensures 
that the browser won't load the script without the consent of the user).
 This also works for other tags such as images or tracking pixels.
  Just remember to always add a data-name attribute that matches the
  name of the app in your config so that Klaro knows which element belongs to which app -->
