# VORIQ
## &nbsp;

## Project Description

**VORIQ** is an independent, non-commercial platform designed to provide users with objective, data-driven insights about products listed on e-commerce sites, car dealerships, manufacturers' websites, and more — strictly based on publicly available information.

The service operates on-demand: a user voluntarily submits a request for a specific product (e.g., by providing a link), and receives an analytically processed report based on open data sources such as reviews, ratings, public forum mentions, and technical specifications.

Users receive:

* A ratio of positive to negative feedback;
* An estimated average lifespan of the product;
* An environmental impact index;
* Sentiment analysis of user reviews (e.g., percentage of enthusiasm, frustration, etc.);
* Frequently reported issues or defects;
* Other valuable metrics extracted via large-scale data analysis.

## Project Mission

**VORIQ** serves as a feedback bridge between consumers and producers.
Our mission is to **shift manufacturers' focus away from short-term consumerism toward durable, high-quality, and environmentally conscious production**.

This shift helps to:

* Reduce ecological damage caused by the disposal of low-lifespan products;
* Raise consumer expectations around product longevity and quality;
* Cut long-term costs for buyers by promoting more durable goods.
* 
Our mission is pursued fully in compliance with all applicable laws and ethical standards, ensuring responsible and lawful operation.

## Team

We are a [group of independent developers](./TEAM.md) and enthusiasts united by the desire to use technology for the benefit of society.  
Our project is not funded by corporations, political entities, or commercial contracts.

We believe that quality, transparent, and open software can influence everyday decisions — from product choices to attitudes toward the environment.

**Our goal** is to contribute to the formation of a conscious society where data serves people rather than manipulates them.

Donations from commercial entities such as marketplaces or manufacturers are accepted and used alongside contributions from individual donors, without receiving special attention or privileges.

We are committed to ethical development practices and adherence to legal and social responsibilities.

Join us if you share these values.  

Read our [Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md) to understand our values and vision.

## Legal Compliance
**VORIQ** strictly adheres to all applicable laws and regulations, including **GDPR** and relevant local legislation.

As described in Project Description, all data collection is performed only upon explicit user request and involves exclusively publicly available information.

We do not engage in mass scraping, do not store or replicate third-party content, and do not collect personal data without explicit user consent.

Our commitment to transparency, privacy, and legal compliance is fundamental to the platform’s operation.

### Why We Use the AGPL-3.0 License

We chose the AGPL-3.0 license because this is a socially significant, community-oriented initiative.

Our goals are:

- To ensure transparency, public benefit, and technical openness;  
- To prevent unauthorized commercial exploitation, especially by large platforms, marketplaces, or vendors;  
- To protect the project from corporate interests that may conflict with its original mission.

The AGPL-3.0 license requires that anyone who uses this code—whether as a service or as part of a modified version—must also share their code under the same license. This includes web-based services (SaaS), not just distributed binaries.

This ensures that improvements, forks, and integrations remain open to the public, sustaining a fair and collaborative ecosystem.

The AGPL-3.0 license ensures that this project and all its derivatives remain open source and accessible to the community, preventing proprietary closures.

## &nbsp;

If you are interested in **commercial use** of this project, please publish a **public request** by [opening a GitHub issue in this repository](../../issues), clearly describing:

- Your intended use case;  
- The scope of integration or modification;  
- Any licensing or partnership proposal you may have.

This ensures full transparency for the community and allows us to evaluate requests openly.
