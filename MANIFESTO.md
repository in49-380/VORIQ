# Manifesto

We believe in a society where consumers have access to transparent, objective, and verifiable information about the products they buy.

We believe that:
- Openness and access to data matter;
- Public feedback is a tool for improving products, not just marketing;
- Sustainability and ethics are a responsibility, not a trend;
- User privacy and dignity must be protected;
- Markets should be shaped by collective intelligence, not manipulation.

We commit to:
- Building non-commercial, unbiased tools;
- Fighting greenwashing, fake reviews, and misleading advertising;
- Protecting user data from misuse and unauthorized monetization;
- Working openly and inviting collaboration from like-minded contributors.

We welcome developers, designers, data scientists, ethical companies, and concerned individuals to help us build a platform for conscious and informed choices.

This is our contribution to a more transparent, fair, and responsible marketplace.
