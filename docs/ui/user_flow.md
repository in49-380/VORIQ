### User Flow: Vehicle Reliability Analysis Platform

## Overview

The application is a single-page interface (SPA) operating entirely through a root `index.html` file. Navigation is handled via dynamic UI state changes rather than URL paths. The file itself is served in a way that **keeps the address bar clean**, i.e., the browser only shows the domain (`https://voriq.info`) without revealing `index.html` or any internal paths.

#### Notes:

* All application logic runs within a single index file.
* The file is served via Envoy or other proxy so that `index.html` never appears in the browserâ€™s address bar.
* No internal routing; navigation is UI state-driven.
* External legal links (Terms, Privacy, Cookies) are accessible before login.
* GitHub icon available at login and footer post-login.
* Legal links can also be retrieved via API (e.g., `/api/meta/privacy`, `/api/meta/terms`, `/api/meta/cookies`) for dynamic injection.
* The list of visited URLs used by the parser is included in the results. Displaying this list is legally permitted as long as only public, non-personal sources are accessed and no copyrighted content is copied or stored.
* A disclaimer is shown the first time a user initiates parsing in a session. It explicitly states that the analysis is based on publicly available user opinions, which may contain subjective or incorrect information. The user must acknowledge this disclaimer to proceed.
* Logout option is available in the application footer.
* Multilanguage support is provided for all interface content; language selection is available in the UI.
* Contextual onboarding hints are displayed for first-time users.
* A visual modal loader with optional countdown or animation is shown during analysis to enhance feedback during long operations.
