## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Do not open public issues for security problems.**

Use **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**:  
Repository → *Security* tab → *Report a vulnerability*.  

This creates a private discussion between you and the maintainers.  
Public disclosure is only made after a fix is released.

## Response & Disclosure
- Acknowledge within **10 business days**
- Triage and assign severity
- Develop and test a fix
- Coordinate release and disclosure timing
- Credit given to the reporter unless anonymity is requested

## Out of Scope
- Clickjacking on non-sensitive pages
- Self-XSS requiring pasting code into console
- Vulnerabilities needing physical access
